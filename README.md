### This project contains:

1. new_tidy_dataset.txt : A dataset that consists of the mean values of several spatial variables related to measurements from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of 30 Samsung Galaxy S phones each of which was handled by a subject. The measurements were taken when the subject was WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, and LAYING. The mean values are taken for each subject while carrying out the 6 different activities, giving us a total of 180 rows in the dataset (30 x 6)
2. UCI HAR Dataset : Directory containing raw data
3. Codebook.md : Codebook containing description of the new_tidy_dataset.txt file and its contents
4. run_analysis.R : Script to process raw data and produce new_tidy_dataset.txt
5. getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip : Compressed Raw data directory.
